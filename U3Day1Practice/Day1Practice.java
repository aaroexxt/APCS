        1) They can only have the type that was declared when the array was initialized, which could be a number (double), a string (String), or even Object.
        2) We refer to an array's element in Java using the syndax arrayName[i] where i is the index of the element to access.
        3) If an index has an invalid value, you get an IndexOutOfBounds exception or other error.
        4) Length of array = arrayName.length
        5) No, you cannot
        6) Default value, i.e. 0 for numbers, "" for string
        7) Basic syntax for constructing = "double[] preciseArray = new double[10];" which creates an array of type double with length 10.
        The difference between declaring and constructing is that declaring an array does not necesarily initialize it (give it a length/make it useable).
        8) The number in the brackets represents the array's length;
        9) It will be [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
        10) It would give 5
        11) B, although C wouldn't be very useful
        12) 0
        13) "Allie"
        14) double[] numberArray = new double[10];
        15) int[] fivePrimes = {2,3,5,7,11};
        16) fivePrimes = {2,3,5,7,2}; after first iter
        fivePrimes = {2,3,5,3,2}; after second iter
        17) fivePrimes = {3,4,6,8,12};
        18) values[0] = 10;
        values[values.length-1] = 10;
        19) String[] words = new String[10];
        20) String[] yesNo = {"Yes","No"};
        21) int[] A = new int[6];
        22) Part A: 0
        Part B: Error, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds (only elements 0-9 exist)
        Part C: Error, ArrayNotInitialized (idk what the exact error is, but the array isn't initialized)
